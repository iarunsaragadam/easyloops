# CodeQuest Desktop

This folder contains a minimal scaffold for the **CodeQuest** desktop application. The app aims to provide an offline environment for solving programming challenges in Go and Python.

## Goals
- Run fully offline on Windows, macOS and Linux using Tauri.
- Ship language runtimes and judge logic so that users can solve problems without installing any additional tools.
- Provide a VS Codeâ€“like editor experience via Monaco Editor.

This folder only includes a placeholder structure. The actual implementation of the features described in the project specification is left for future work.
