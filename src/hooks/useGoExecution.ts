Note: Go code execution requires a backend service with Go compiler.
This is a mock implementation for demonstration purposes.

1. Set up a backend service with Go compiler
2. Send code to backend via API
3. Compile and run Go code on server
4. Return results to frontend

Test cases would be executed on the backend service.`;
