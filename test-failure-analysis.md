# Test Failure Analysis and Fix Recommendations

## Summary
After the previous fixes that reduced test failures from 22 to 11, there are still 8 failing tests remaining in the PyodideRuntime comprehensive test suite. The failures are caused by mock contamination between tests.

## Current Status
- **Total Tests**: 242
- **Passing Tests**: 231 
- **Failing Tests**: 11 (8 in PyodideRuntime comprehensive, 3 in other suites)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Mock Contamination
The main problem is that `mockPyodide.runPythonAsync.mockImplementation()` is being used in several tests to simulate error conditions, but these implementations persist across tests and are not properly reset between test runs.

### Specific Failing Tests:

1. **Memory-intensive operations test** (`line 314`)
   - **Expected**: `result.testResults[0].passed` to be `true`
   - **Actual**: `false`
   - **Cause**: Mock is contaminated by previous error-throwing implementation

2. **Input/Output handling tests** (4 tests failing)
   - **Expected**: Test results to pass when output matches expected
   - **Actual**: Tests fail due to mock contamination
   - **Affected tests**:
     - "should handle different line ending formats" 
     - "should handle empty input files"
     - "should handle very large input files"
     - "should handle input with special characters"

3. **Security test** (`line 609`)
   - **Expected**: Code execution to be sandboxed but successful
   - **Actual**: Test fails due to mock throwing errors

4. **Performance tests** (2 tests failing)
   - **Expected**: Rapid successive executions to work
   - **Actual**: Mock contamination causes failures
   - **Additional issue**: `mockPyodide.globals.clear` not being called as expected

## Technical Details

### Mock Implementation Issues
```typescript
// Problem: This persists across tests
mockPyodide.runPythonAsync.mockImplementation(() => {
  throw new Error("ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'nonexistent'");
});
```

### Current Mock Reset
```typescript
beforeEach(() => {
  jest.clearAllMocks(); // This clears mock calls but not implementations
  // ... other setup
});
```

## Fix Recommendations

### 1. Reset Mock Implementation in beforeEach
```typescript
beforeEach(() => {
  jest.clearAllMocks();
  
  // Reset mock implementations
  mockPyodide.runPythonAsync.mockReset();
  mockPyodide.runPythonAsync.mockImplementation(() => Promise.resolve(undefined));
  mockPyodide.globals.clear.mockReset();
  
  // ... rest of setup
});
```

### 2. Use mockResolvedValue Instead of mockImplementation
For tests that need specific return values, use `mockResolvedValue` or `mockResolvedValueOnce` instead of `mockImplementation`:

```typescript
// Instead of:
mockPyodide.runPythonAsync.mockImplementation(() => {
  throw new Error("some error");
});

// Use:
mockPyodide.runPythonAsync.mockRejectedValueOnce(new Error("some error"));
```

### 3. Test-Specific Mock Setup
Ensure each test properly sets up its own mock configuration:

```typescript
it('should handle memory-intensive operations', async () => {
  // Clear any previous mock setup
  mockPyodide.runPythonAsync.mockReset();
  
  // Set up test-specific mocks
  mockPyodide.runPythonAsync
    .mockResolvedValueOnce(undefined) // Setup environment
    .mockResolvedValueOnce(undefined) // Execute user code
    .mockResolvedValueOnce('Memory allocation failed'); // Get output
  
  // ... rest of test
});
```

### 4. Fix Mock Call Expectations
For the "memory cleanup" test, ensure the mock is properly configured to track calls:

```typescript
it('should handle memory cleanup between executions', async () => {
  // Ensure globals.clear mock is reset and configured
  mockPyodide.globals.clear.mockReset();
  mockPyodide.globals.clear.mockImplementation(() => {});
  
  // ... rest of test
});
```

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Immediate Fix**: Update the `beforeEach` block to properly reset mock implementations
2. **Test-by-Test**: Review each failing test to ensure proper mock setup
3. **Validation**: Run tests to verify all 8 failing tests now pass
4. **Prevention**: Add comments to prevent future mock contamination

## Expected Outcome
After implementing these fixes, all 8 remaining PyodideRuntime comprehensive tests should pass, bringing the total failing tests down to 3 (from other test suites).

## Additional Notes
- The previous fixes for async mocking (`runPythonAsync` instead of `runPython`) are working correctly
- The core PyodideRuntime implementation is sound - the issues are purely test-related
- Some tests may need slight adjustments to their expectations based on the actual mock behavior

This analysis shows that the remaining failures are entirely due to test setup issues rather than actual implementation problems.
