# Agent Development Guidelines

## Dependency Policy

- As much as possible, do **not** use any dependencies which are not provided or maintained by major developers (such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft, etc.).
- Prefer first-party or officially supported libraries from the major frameworks or platforms.
- If a third-party dependency is absolutely necessary, document the reason and consider the maintenance and security risks.
