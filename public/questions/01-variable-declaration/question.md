# Variable Declaration and Initialization

## Problem Statement

Write a program that demonstrates proper variable declaration and initialization for different data types. Your program should read values from standard input and use them to demonstrate various programming concepts.

Your program should:

1. Read input values and declare variables of the following types:

   - Integer (read from line 1)
   - String (read from line 2)
   - Boolean (read from line 3)
   - Floating-point number (read from line 4)
   - Character (read from line 5)

2. Print each variable with a descriptive label showing its type and value

3. Demonstrate variable reassignment by:

   - Reading a new integer value (from line 6)
   - Reassigning the integer variable to this new value
   - Printing the updated value

4. Show late initialization by:
   - Reading a value for late initialization (from line 7)
   - Declaring a variable without initializing it (where supported by the language)
   - Then initializing it with the read value
   - Printing the final result

## Input Format

The input consists of 7 lines:

```
Line 1: Integer value (e.g., 42)
Line 2: String value (e.g., "Hello, World!")
Line 3: Boolean value (true or false)
Line 4: Floating-point number (e.g., 3.14159)
Line 5: Single character (e.g., A)
Line 6: New integer value for reassignment (e.g., 100)
Line 7: String value for late initialization (e.g., "Programming")
```

## Test Cases

**Input (`input.txt`):**

```
42
Hello, World!
true
3.14159
A
100
Programming
```

**Expected Output (`expected.txt`):**

```
Integer variable: 42
String variable: Hello, World!
Boolean variable: true
Float variable: 3.14159
Character variable: A
Updated integer variable: 100
Late-initialized variable: Programming
```

## How to Test Your Solution

1. Copy your template file: `cp templates/python_template.py solution.py`
2. Implement your solution in the `solve()` function
3. Test with: `cat input.txt | python solution.py > output.txt`
4. Compare: `diff output.txt expected.txt`
5. If `diff` shows nothing, your solution is correct! âœ…

## Learning Objectives

- Understand different data types available in programming languages
- Learn the difference between variable declaration and initialization
- Practice proper variable naming conventions
- Understand variable reassignment
- Learn about type inference (in languages that support it)
- Practice reading input from stdin in the correct order

## Implementation Guidelines

### Python Example Structure:

```python
def solve():
    # Read input values
    integer_val = int(input())
    string_val = input().strip()
    boolean_val = input().strip() == "true"
    float_val = float(input())
    char_val = input().strip()
    new_integer_val = int(input())
    late_init_val = input().strip()

    # Your variable declaration and output logic here
    # ...
```

### Go Example Structure:

```go
func solve() {
    // Read input values
    scanner.Scan()
    integerVal, _ := strconv.Atoi(scanner.Text())

    scanner.Scan()
    stringVal := scanner.Text()

    scanner.Scan()
    booleanVal := scanner.Text() == "true"

    // Continue reading other values...
    // Your variable declaration and output logic here
}
```

## Constraints

- Use meaningful variable names that follow the language's naming conventions
- Include comments explaining each step
- Handle languages that don't support certain data types gracefully
- Output format must match exactly (including spacing and punctuation)

## Hints

- Some languages require explicit type declaration, others support type inference
- Pay attention to the language's naming conventions (camelCase, snake_case, etc.)
- Consider how different languages handle uninitialized variables
- Be careful with boolean parsing - check if input is "true" or "false"
- Character handling varies by language (some use single chars, others use strings)
