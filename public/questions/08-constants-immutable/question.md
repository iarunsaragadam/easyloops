# Constants and Immutable Values

## Problem Statement

Write a program that demonstrates the concept of constants and immutable values by calculating circle properties using mathematical constants.

## Input Format

The input consists of 1 line:

```
Line 1: Radius of circle (e.g., 5.0)
```

## Test Cases

**Input (`input.txt`):**

```
5.0
```

**Expected Output (`expected.txt`):**

```
Radius: 5.0
PI constant: 3.14159
Circumference: 31.4159
Area: 78.53975
```

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of constants
- Practice using mathematical constants
- Learn about immutable values
- Practice calculations with constants

## Implementation Guidelines

### Python Example Structure:

```python
def solve():
    PI = 3.14159  # Constant
    radius = float(input())

    print(f"Radius: {radius}")
    print(f"PI constant: {PI}")
    # ... continue calculations
```
